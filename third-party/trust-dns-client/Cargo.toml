description = """
Trust-DNS is a safe and secure DNS library. This is the Client library with DNSec support.
 DNSSec with NSEC validation for negative records, is complete. The client supports
 dynamic DNS with SIG0 authenticated requests, implementing easy to use high level
 funtions. Trust-DNS is based on the Tokio and Futures libraries, which means
 it should be easily integrated into other software that also use those
 libraries.
