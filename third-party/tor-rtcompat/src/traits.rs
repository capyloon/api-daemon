/// A runtime that we can use to run Tor as a client.
///
/// This trait comprises several other traits that we require all of our
/// runtimes to provide:
///
/// * [`futures::task::Spawn`] to launch new background tasks.
/// * [`SleepProvider`] to pause a task for a given amount of time.
/// * [`TcpProvider`] to launch and accept TCP connections.
/// * [`TlsProvider`] to launch TLS connections.
/// * [`BlockOn`] to block on a future and run it to completion
///   (This may become optional in the future, if/when we add WASM
///   support).
///
/// We require that every `Runtime` has an efficient [`Clone`] implementation
/// that gives a new opaque reference to the same underlying runtime.
///
/// Additionally, every `Runtime` is [`Send`] and [`Sync`], though these
/// requirements may be somewhat relaxed in the future.
///
/// At some future point,
/// Arti may require that the runtime `impl<S> TlsProvider<S>` (for suitable`S`),
/// rather than just for their own `TcpStream`s.
/// I.e., Arti may start to require that the runtime's TLS provider can wrap any streams,
/// not only the runtime's own TCP streams.
/// This might be expressed as an additional supertrait bound on `Runtime`,
/// eg when Rust supports GATs,
/// or as an additional bound on the Arti APIs that currently use `Runtime`.
/// For API future compatibility, if you `impl Runtime for MyRuntime`,
/// you should also ensure that you
/// ```ignore
/// impl<S> TlsProvider<S> for MyRuntime
/// where S: futures::AsyncRead + futures::AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send + 'static
/// ```
//
/// Perhaps we will need this if we make our own TLS connections *through* Tor,
/// rather than just channels to guards.

/// Note that because of Tor's peculiarities, this is not a

/// its TLS library to check whether the certificates used in TLS are signed
/// within the web PKI hierarchy, or what their hostnames are, or even whether
/// they are valid.  It *does*, however, check that the subject public key in the
/// certificate is indeed correctly used to authenticate the TLS handshake.
///
/// If you are implementing something other than Tor, this is **not** the
/// functionality you want.
///
/// How can this behavior be remotely safe, even in Tor?  It only works for Tor
/// because the certificate that a Tor relay uses in TLS is not actually being
/// used to certify that relay's public key.  Instead, the certificate only used
/// as a container for the relay's public key.  The real certification happens
/// later, inside the TLS session, when the relay presents a CERTS cell.
///
/// Such sneakiness was especially necessary before TLS 1.3, which encrypts more
/// of the handshake, and before pluggable transports, which make
/// "innocuous-looking TLS handshakes" less important than they once were.  Once
/// TLS 1.3 is completely ubiquitous, we might be able to specify a simpler link
/// handshake than Tor uses now.
