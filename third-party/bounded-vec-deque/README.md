`bounded-vec-deque` provides a [`VecDeque`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html) wrapper with an upper bound on the length.

See [the type-level documentation on the `docs.rs.` website](https://docs.rs/bounded-vec-deque/*/bounded_vec_deque/struct.BoundedVecDeque.html) (or in `src/lib.rs` if you prefer) for more information. Source code, revision history, and issue tracking are available [on the `gitlab.com.` website](https://gitlab.com/Moongoodboy/bounded-vec-deque). `bounded-vec-deque` releases are additionally published on `crates.io.`.

## Caveats Up Front

`bounded-vec-deque` requires Rust 1.28.0 (released 2018-08-02) or later.
