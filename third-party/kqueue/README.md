`kqueue(2)` library for rust

`kqueue(2)` is a powerful API in BSDs that allows you to get events based on
fs events, buffer readiness, timers, process events and signals.

This is useful for code that's either BSD-specific, or as a component in an
abstraction over similar APIs in cross-platform code.
