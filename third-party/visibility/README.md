#### Attribute to override the visibility of items (especially useful in conjunction with `#[cfg_attr(â€¦)]`).

Since it is currently not possible to conditionally modify the visibility of an
item, but since it is possible to conditionally apply an attribute, this crate
features a trivial attribute that modifies the visibility of the decorated item.
This way, by conditionally applying it, one can achieve the desired goal:

## Example

```rust
/// Some fancy docs.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// ::my_crate::module::foo();
/// ```
// Assuming `cargo test --doc --features integration-tests` is run:
#[cfg_attr(feature = "integration-tests", visibility::make(pub))]
mod module {
    pub fn foo() {}
}
```
