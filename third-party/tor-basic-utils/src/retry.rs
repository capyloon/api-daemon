/// An implementation for retrying a remote operation based on a [decorrelated
/// jitter] schedule.
///
/// The algorithm used here has several desirable properties:
///    * It is randomized, so that multiple timeouts don't have a danger of
///      getting synchronized with each other and hammering the same servers all
///      at once.
///    * It tends on average to wait longer and longer over time, so that if the
///      server is down, it won't get pummeled by a zillion failing clients
///      when it comes back up.
///    * It has a chance of retrying promptly, which results in better client
///      performance on average.
///
