    ///
    /// ### Sources of linkage:
    ///
    ///  * If we connect to a relay and it proves a set of identities,
    ///    that necessarily will include at least the ones we have already.
    ///    We can add any other identities we have discovered.

    ///    we can combine the entries.

    ///
    ///  * For a configured bridge, if our configuration links some identities,
    ///    we must insist on all those identities.
    ///    So we combine them.
    ///
    /// ### Handling of conflicting entries:
    ///
    /// `ByRelayIds` will implicitly delete conflicting entries,
    /// simply forgetting about them.
    /// This is OK for netdir relays, since we do not expect this to occur in practice.
    ///
    /// For bridges, conflicts may in fact occur,
    /// since bridge lines are not issued by a single authority,
    /// and should be afforded limited trust.
    ///
    ///  * If the configuration contains bridge lines that mutually conflict,
    ///    affected bridge lines should be disregarded,
    ///    or the configuration rejected.
    ///
    ///  * If the configuration contains information which is inconsistent with
    ///    our past experience, we should discard the past experiences which
    ///    aren't reconcilable with the configuration.
    ///
    ///  * We may discover a linkage which demonstrates that the configuration
    ///    is wrong: for example, two bridge lines for identities X and Y,
    ///    but in fact there is only one bridge with both identities.
    ///    In this situation it is OK to effectively disregard some the configuration
