//! Help the guard manager (and other crates) deal with "pending
//! information".
//!
//! There are two kinds of pending information to deal with.  First,
//! every guard that we hand out needs to be marked as succeeded or
//! failed. Second, if a guard is given out on an exploratory basis,
//! then the circuit manager can't know whether to use a circuit built
//! through that guard until the guard manager tells it.  This is
//! handled via [`GuardUsable`].
