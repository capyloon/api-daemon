//! `tor-guardmgr`: guard node selection for Tor network clients.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This crate is part of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
//!
//! "Guard nodes" are mechanism that Tor clients uses to limit the
//! impact of hostile relays. Approximately: each client chooses a
//! small set of relays to use as its "guards".  Later, when the
//! client picks its paths through network, rather than choosing a
//! different first hop randomly for every path, it chooses the best
//! "guard" as the first hop.
//!
//! This crate provides [`GuardMgr`], an object that manages a set of
//! guard nodes, and helps the `tor-circmgr` crate know when to use
//! them.
//!
//! Guard nodes are persistent across multiple process invocations.
//!
//! More Arti users won't need to use this crate directly.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! What's the point?  By restricting their first hops to a small set,
//! clients increase their odds against traffic-correlation attacks.
//! Since we assume that an adversary who controls both ends of a
//! circuit can correlate its traffic, choosing many circuits with
//! random entry points will eventually cause a client to eventually
//! pick an attacker-controlled circuit, with probability approaching
//! 1 over time.  If entry nodes are restricted to a small set,
//! however, then the client has a chance of never picking an
//! attacker-controlled circuit.
//!
//! (The actual argument is a little more complicated here, and it
//! relies on the assumption that, since the attacker knows
//! statistics, exposing _any_ of your traffic is nearly as bad as
//! exposing _all_ of your traffic.)
//!
//! # Complications
//!
//! The real algorithm for selecting and using guards can get more
//! complicated because of a variety of factors.
//!
//! - In reality, we can't just "pick a few guards at random" and use
//!   them forever: relays can appear and disappear, relays can go
//!   offline and come back online, and so on.  What's more, keeping
//!   guards for too long can make targeted attacks against those
//!   guards more attractive.
//!
//! - Further, we may have particular restrictions on where we can
//!   connect. (For example, we might be restricted to ports 80 and
//!   443, but only when we're on a commuter train's wifi network.)
//!
//! - We need to resist attacks from local networks that block all but a
//!   small set of guard relays, to force us to choose those.
//!
//! - We need to give good, reliable performance while using the
//!   guards that we prefer.
//!
//! These needs complicate our API somewhat.  Instead of simply asking
//! the `GuardMgr` for a guard, the circuit-management code needs to
//! be able to tell the `GuardMgr` that a given guard has failed (or
//! succeeded), and that it needs a different guard in the future (or
//! not).
//!
//! Further, the `GuardMgr` code needs to be able to hand out
//! _provisional guards_, in effect saying "You can try building a
//! circuit with this guard, but please don't actually _use_ that
//! circuit unless I tell you it's safe."
//!
//! For details on the exact algorithm, see `guard-spec.txt` (link
//! below) and comments and internal documentation in this crate.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! * Our circuit blocking algorithm is simplified from the one that Tor uses.
//!   See comments in `GuardSet::circ_usability_status` for more information.
//!   See also [proposal 337](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/main/proposals/337-simpler-guard-usability.md).

//! Privacy.  (See <https://www.freehaven.net/anonbib/#wright03>)
