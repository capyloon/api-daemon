//! Abstract code to manage a set of circuits.
//!
//! This module implements the real logic for deciding when and how to
//! launch circuits, and for which circuits to hand out in response to
//! which requests.
//!
//! For testing and abstraction purposes, this module _does not_
//! actually know anything about circuits _per se_.  Instead,
//! everything is handled using a set of traits that are internal to this
//! crate:
//!
//!  * [`AbstractCirc`] is a view of a circuit.
//!  * [`AbstractSpec`] represents a circuit's possible usages.
//!  * [`AbstractCircBuilder`] knows how to build an `AbstractCirc`.
//!
//! Using these traits, the [`AbstractCircMgr`] object manages a set of
//! circuits, launching them as necessary, and keeping track of the
//! restrictions on their use.

// TODO:
// - Testing
//    - Error from prepare_action()
//    - Error reported by restrict_mut?
