//! Code for estimating good values for circuit timeouts.
//!
//! We need good circuit timeouts for two reasons: first, they help
//! user experience.  If user wait too long for their circuits, or if
//! they use exceptionally slow circuits, then Tor will feel really
//! slow.  Second, these timeouts are actually a security
//! property.
// TODO(nickm): explain why!
