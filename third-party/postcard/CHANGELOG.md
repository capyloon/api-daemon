## 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2

* Correct exporting of experimental Schema proc macro ([PR#73])

[PR#73]: https://github.com/jamesmunns/postcard/pull/73

## 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1

* [Fixed deserialization] of `i128`, which was using the "new style" varint serialization, but the incorrect, "old style" fixed deserialization.
    * This is considered a defect, and not a breaking change, as it brings the code back in line with the specification behavior.
    * Version 1.0.0 will be yanked due to this defect.

[Fixed deserialization]: https://github.com/jamesmunns/postcard/commit/70ea33a1ac7f82632697f4578002267eaf9095f5

## 1.0.0-alpha.4 -> 1.0.0

* Added experimental derive features
* Made Flavor fields private again
* Optimized varint encoding
* Use crate `Result` for `Flavor`s

## 1.0.0-alpha.3 -> 1.0.0-alpha.4

* Updated the signature of deserialization `Flavor` trait
* Added documentation and tests
* Removed the `Encoder` wrapper type to better match serialization and deserialization types
* Renamed `ser_flavor::Flavor::release` to `finalize` for consistency
* Re-organized some public items and modules
* Made `Error` non-exhaustive
* Added a `fixint` type to avoid varints

## 1.0.0-alpha.2 -> 1.0.0-alpha.3

* Moved back to `cobs` from `postcard-cobs`
    * This fixed a number of upstream issues, including removal of panicking branches
* Improved documentation and code examples
* Corrected the behavior of `take_from_cobs`
* Added support for serializing `Debug`/`Display` representation strings via serde's `collect_str` method (and removed the panic)

## 1.0.0-alpha.1 -> 1.0.0-alpha.2

* Re-exposed fields of the Flavor constructors, made various flavors impl `Default`
* No breaking changes vs `1.0.0-alpha.1`.

## 0.7.3 -> 1.0.0-alpha.1

* WARNING: This includes a BREAKING wire change from postcard v0.x.y! Please ensure
    all devices using postcard are recompiled with the newest version!
* added `#[inline]` to many functions, increasing performance
* All unsigned integers u16-u128 are varint encoded
* All signed integers i16-i128 are zigzag + varint encoded
* Serialization flavors have been tweaked slightly, with the `Slice` flavor now faster
* Introduction of Deserialization flavors
* Please report any bugs upstream as we prepare for the v1.0.0 release!

## 0.7.2 -> 0.7.3

* Added optional [`defmt`](https://crates.io/crates/defmt) support with the `use-defmt` feature.
* Improved docs

## 0.7.1 -> 0.7.2

* Changed the `CobsAccumulator::new()` into a const fn.

## 0.7.0 -> 0.7.1

* Added the `CobsAccumulator` type for accumulating COBS encoded data for deserialization.

## 0.6.x -> 0.7.0

* Updated `heapless` dependency to `v0.7.0`, which added support for const-generic sized buffers.

## Prior to 0.7.0

* No changelog information added yet.
