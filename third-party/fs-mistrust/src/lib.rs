//! # `fs-mistrust`: check whether file permissions are private.
//!
//! This crate provides a set of functionality to check the permissions on files
//! and directories to ensure that they are effectively privateâ€”that is, that
//! they are only readable or writable by trusted[^1] users.
//!
//! This kind of check can protect your users' data against misconfigurations,
//! such as cases where they've accidentally made their home directory
//! world-writable, or where they're using a symlink stored in a directory owned
//! by another user.
//!
//! The checks in this crate try to guarantee that, after a path has been shown
//! to be private, no action by a _non-trusted user_ can make that path private.
//! It's still possible for a _trusted user_ to change a path after it has been
//! checked.  Because of that, you may want to use other mechanisms if you are
//! concerned about time-of-check/time-of-use issues caused by _trusted_ users
//! altering the filesystem.
//!
//! Also see the [Limitations](#limitations) section below.
//!
//! [^1]: we define "trust" here in the computer-security sense of the word: a
//!      user is "trusted" if they have the opportunity to break our security
//!      guarantees.  For example, `root` on a Unix environment is "trusted",
//!      whether you actually trust them or not.
//!
//! ## What's so hard about checking permissions?
//!
//! Suppose that we want to know whether a given path can be read or modified by
//! an untrusted user. That's trickier than it sounds:
//!
//! * Even if the permissions on the file itself are correct, we also need to
//!   check the permissions on the directory holding it, since they might allow
//!   an untrusted user to replace the file, or change its permissions.  
//! * Similarly, we need to check the permissions on the parent of _that_
//!   directory, since they might let an untrusted user replace the directory or
//!   change _its_ permissions.  (And so on!)
//! * It can be tricky to define "a trusted user".  On Unix systems, we usually
//!   say that each user is trusted by themself, and that root (UID 0) is
//!   trusted.  But it's hard to say which _groups_ are trusted: even if a given
//!   group contains only trusted users today, there's no OS-level guarantee
//!   that untrusted users won't be added to that group in the future.
//! * Symbolic links add another layer of confusion.  If there are any symlinks
//!   in the path you're checking, then you need to check permissions on the
//!   directory containing the symlink, and then the permissions on the target
//!   path, _and all of its ancestors_ too.
//! * Many programs first canonicalize the path being checked, removing all
//!   `..`s and symlinks.  That's sufficient for telling whether the _final_
//!   file can be modified by an untrusted user, but not for whether the _path_
//!   can be modified by an untrusted user.  If there is a modifiable symlink in
//!   the middle of the path, or at any stage of the path resolution, somebody
//!   who can modify that symlink can change which file the path points to.
//! * Even if you have checked a directory as being writeable only by a trusted
//!   user, that doesn't mean that the objects _in_ that directory are only
//!   writeable by trusted users.  Those objects might be symlinks to some other
//!   (more writeable) place on the file system; or they might be accessible
//!   with hard links stored elsewhere on the file system.
//!
//! Different programs try to solve this problem in different ways, often with
//! very little rationale.  This crate tries to give a reasonable implementation
//! for file privacy checking and enforcement, along with clear justifications
//! in its source for why it behaves that way.
//!
//!
//! ## What we actually do
//!
//! To make sure that every step in the file resolution process is checked, we
//! emulate that process on our own.  We inspect each component in the provided
//! path, to see whether it is modifiable by an untrusted user.  If we encounter
//! one or more symlinks, then we resolve every component of the path added by
//! those symlink, until we finally reach the target.
//!
//! In effect, we are emulating `realpath` (or `fs::canonicalize` if you
//! prefer), and looking at the permissions on every part of the filesystem we
//! touch in doing so, to see who has permissions to change our target file or
//! the process that led us to it.
//!
//! For groups, we use the following heuristic: If there is a group with the
//! same name as the current user, and the current user belongs to that group,
//! we assume that group is trusted.  Otherwise, we treat all groups as
//! untrusted.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### Simple cases
//!
//! Make sure that a directory is only readable or writeable by us (simple
//! case):
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fs_mistrust::Mistrust;
//! match Mistrust::new().check_directory("/home/itchy/.local/hat-swap") {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("directory is good"),
//!     Err(e) => println!("problem with our hat-swap directory: {}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! As above, but create the directory, and its parents if they do not already
//! exist.
//!
//! ```
//! use fs_mistrust::Mistrust;
//! match Mistrust::new().make_directory("/home/itchy/.local/hat-swap") {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("directory exists (or was created without trouble"),
//!     Err(e) => println!("problem with our hat-swap directory: {}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Configuring a [`Mistrust`]
//!
//! You can adjust the [`Mistrust`] object to change what it permits:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn example() -> fs_mistrust::Result<()> {
//! use fs_mistrust::Mistrust;
//!
//! let my_mistrust = Mistrust::builder()
//!     // Assume that our home directory and its parents are all well-configured.
//!     .ignore_prefix("/home/doze/")
//!     // Assume that a given group will only contain trusted users (this feature is only
//!     // available on Unix-like platforms).
//!     // .trust_group(413)
//!     .build()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See [`Mistrust`] for more options.
//!
//! ### Using [`Verifier`] for more fine-grained checks
//!
//! For more fine-grained control over a specific check, you can use the
//! [`Verifier`] API.  Unlike [`Mistrust`], which generally you'll want to
//! configure for several requests, the changes in [`Verifier`] generally make
//! sense only for one request at a time.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn example() -> fs_mistrust::Result<()> {
//! use fs_mistrust::Mistrust;
//! let mistrust = Mistrust::new();
//!
//! // Require that an object is a regular file; allow it to be world-
//! // readable.
//! mistrust
//!     .verifier()
//!     .permit_readable()
//!     .require_file()
//!     .check("/home/trace/.path_cfg")?;
//!
//! // Make sure that a directory _and all of its contents_ are private.
//! // Create the directory if it does not exist.
//! // Return an error object containing _all_ of the problems discovered.
//! mistrust
//!     .verifier()
//!     .require_directory()
//!     .check_content()
//!     .all_errors()
//!     .make_directory("/home/trace/private_keys/");
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! See [`Verifier`] for more options.
//!
//! ### Using [`CheckedDir`] for safety.
//!
//! You can use the [`CheckedDir`] API to ensure not only that a directory is
//! private, but that all of your accesses to its contents continue to verify
//! and enforce _their_ permissions.
//!
//! ```
//! # fn example() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//! use fs_mistrust::{Mistrust, CheckedDir};
//! use std::fs::{File, OpenOptions};
//! let dir = Mistrust::new()
//!     .verifier()
//!     .secure_dir("/Users/clover/riddles")?;
//!
//! // You can use the CheckedDir object to access files and directories.
//! // All of these must be relative paths within the path you used to
//! // build the CheckedDir.
//! dir.make_directory("timelines")?;
//! let file = dir.open("timelines/vault-destroyed.md",
//!     OpenOptions::new().write(true).create(true))?;
//! // (... use file...)
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! As noted above, this crate only checks whether a path can be changed by
//! _non-trusted_ users.  After the path has been checked, a _trusted_ user can
//! still change its permissions.  (For example, the user could make their home
//! directory world-writable.)  This crate does not try to defend against _that
//! kind_ of time-of-check/time-of-use issue.
//!
//! We currently assume a fairly vanilla Unix environment: we'll tolerate other
//! systems, but we don't actually look at the details of any of these:
//!    * Windows security (ACLs, SecurityDescriptors, etc)
//!    * SELinux capabilities
//!    * POSIX (and other) ACLs.
//!
//! We use a somewhat inaccurate heuristic when we're checking the permissions
//! of items _inside_ a target directory (using [`Verifier::check_content`] or
//! [`CheckedDir`]): we continue to forbid untrusted-writeable directories and
//! files, but we still allow readable ones, even if we insisted that the target
//! directory itself was required to to be unreadable.  This is too permissive
//! in the case of readable objects with hard links: if there is a hard link to
//! the file somewhere else, then an untrusted user can read it.  It is also too
//! restrictive in the case of writeable objects _without_ hard links: if
//! untrusted users have no path to those objects, they can't actually write
//! them.
//!
//! On Windows, we accept all file permissions and owners.
//!
//! We don't check for mount-points and the privacy of filesystem devices
//! themselves.  (For example, we don't distinguish between our local
//! administrator and the administrator of a remote filesystem. We also don't
//! distinguish between local filesystems and insecure networked filesystems.)
//!
//! This code has not been audited for correct operation in a setuid
//! environment; there are almost certainly security holes in that case.
//!
//! This is fairly new software, and hasn't been audited yet.
//!
//! All of the above issues are considered "good to fix, if practical".
//!

    //   hard to provoke without calling set_current_dir(), which isn't good
    //   manners in a test.
