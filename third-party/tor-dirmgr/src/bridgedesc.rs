///  * A public entrypoint, or task, obtains a [`StateGuard`].
///    It modifies the state to represent the callers' new requirements,
///    or things it has done, by updating the state,
///    preserving the invariants but disturbing the "liveness" (see below).
///
///  * [`StateGuard::drop`] calls [`State::process`].
///    This restores the liveness properties.
///
/// ### Possible states of a bridge:
///
/// A bridge can be in one of the following states,
/// represented by its presence in these particular data structures inside `State`:
///
///  * `running`/`queued`: newly added, no outcome yet.
///  * `current` + `running`/`queued`: we are fetching (or going to)
///  * `current = OK` + `refetch_schedule`: fetched OK, will refetch before expiry
///  * `current = Err` + `retry_schedule`: failed, will retry at some point
///
/// ### Invariants:
///
/// Can be disrupted in the middle of a principal function,
/// but should be restored on return.
///
/// * **Tracked**:
///   Each bridge appears at most once in
///   `running`, `queued`, `refetch_schedule` and `retry_schedule`.
///   We call such a bridge Tracked.
///
/// * **Current**
///   Every bridge in `current` is Tracked.
///   (But not every Tracked bridge is necessarily in `current`, yet.)
///
/// * **Schedules**
///   Every bridge in `refetch_schedule` or `retry_schedule` is also in `current`.
///
/// * **Input**:
///   Exactly each bridge that was passed to
///   the last call to [`set_bridges()`](BridgeDescMgr::set_bridges) is Tracked.
///   (If we encountered spawn failures, we treat this as trying to shut down,
///   so we cease attempts to get bridges, and discard the relevant state, violating this.)
///
/// * **Limit**:
///   `running` is capped at the effective parallelism: zero if we are dormant,
///   the configured parallelism otherwise.
///
/// ### Liveness properties:
///
/// These can be disrupted by any function which holds a [`StateGuard`].
/// Will be restored by [`process()`](State::process),
/// which is called when `StateGuard` is dropped.
///
/// Functions that take a `StateGuard` may disturb these invariants
/// and rely on someone else to restore them.
///
/// * **Running**:
///   If `queued` is nonempty, `running` is full.
///
/// * **Timeout**:
///   `earliest_timeout` is the earliest timeout in
///   either `retry_schedule` or `refetch_schedule`.
///   (Disturbances of this property which occur due to system time warps
///   are not necessarily detected and remedied in a timely way,
