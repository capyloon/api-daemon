/// An anonymized stream over the Tor network.
///
/// For most purposes, you can think of this type as an anonymized
/// TCP stream: it can read and write data, and get closed when it's done.
///
/// [`DataStream`] implements [`futures::io::AsyncRead`] and
/// [`futures::io::AsyncWrite`], so you can use it anywhere that those
/// traits are expected.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Connecting to an HTTP server and sending a request, using
/// [`AsyncWriteExt::write_all`](futures::io::AsyncWriteExt::write_all):
///
/// ```ignore
/// let mut stream = tor_client.connect(("icanhazip.com", 80), None).await?;
///
/// use futures::io::AsyncWriteExt;
///
/// stream
///     .write_all(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: icanhazip.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n")
///     .await?;
///
/// // Flushing the stream is important; see below!
/// stream.flush().await?;
/// ```
///
/// Reading the result, using [`AsyncReadExt::read_to_end`](futures::io::AsyncReadExt::read_to_end):
///
/// ```ignore
/// use futures::io::AsyncReadExt;
///
/// let mut buf = Vec::new();
/// stream.read_to_end(&mut buf).await?;
///
/// println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf));
/// ```
///
/// # Usage with Tokio
///
/// If the `tokio` crate feature is enabled, this type also implements
/// [`tokio::io::AsyncRead`](tokio_crate::io::AsyncRead) and
/// [`tokio::io::AsyncWrite`](tokio_crate::io::AsyncWrite) for easier integration
/// with code that expects those traits.
///
/// # Remember to call `flush`!
///
/// DataStream buffers data internally, in order to write as few cells
/// as possible onto the network.  In order to make sure that your
/// data has actually been sent, you need to make sure that
/// [`AsyncWrite::poll_flush`] runs to completion: probably via
/// [`AsyncWriteExt::flush`](futures::io::AsyncWriteExt::flush).
///

///
/// This type is internally composed of a [`DataReader`] and a [`DataWriter`]; the
/// `DataStream::split` method can be used to split it into those two parts, for more
/// convenient usage with e.g. stream combinators.
// # Semver note
