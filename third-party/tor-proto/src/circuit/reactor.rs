//! Code to handle incoming cells on a circuit.
//!
//! ## On message validation
//!
//! There are three steps for validating an incoming message on a stream:
//!
//! 1. Is the message contextually appropriate? (e.g., no more than one
//!    `CONNECTED` message per stream.) This is handled by calling
//!    [`CmdChecker::check_msg`](crate::stream::CmdChecker::check_msg).
//! 2. Does the message comply with flow-control rules? (e.g., no more data than
//!    we've gotten SENDMEs for.) For open streams, the stream itself handles
//!    this; for half-closed streams, the reactor handles it using the
//!    `halfstream` module.
//! 3. Does the message have an acceptable command type, and is the message
//!    well-formed? For open streams, the streams themselves handle this check.
//!    For half-closed streams, the reactor handles it by calling
//!    `consume_checked_msg()`.
