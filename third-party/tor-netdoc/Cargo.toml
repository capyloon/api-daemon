# Enable the "ns consensus" document type, which some relays cache and serve.

# Enable experimental APIs that are not yet officially supported.
#
# These APIs are not covered by semantic versioning.  Using this
# feature voids your "semver warrantee".

# Expose various struct fields as "pub", for testing.
#
# This feature is *super* dangerous for stability and correctness. If you use it
# for anything besides testing, you are probably putting your users in danger.
#
# The struct fields exposed by this feature are not covered by semantic version.
# In fact, using this feature will give you the opposite of a "semver
# guarantee": you should be mildly surprised when your code _doesn't_ break from
# version to version.
