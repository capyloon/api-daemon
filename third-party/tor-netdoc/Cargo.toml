# This feature is *super* dangerous for stability and correctness. If you use it
# for anything besides testing, you are probably putting your users in danger.

# The struct fields exposed by this feature are not covered by semantic version.
# In fact, using this feature will give you the opposite of a "semver
# guarantee": you should be mildly surprised when your code _doesn't_ break from
# version to version.
